# EMI SPARQL Examples

We collect the SPARQL examples in different formats, for different projects where we have a public SPARQL endpoint.
This website is fully inspired by the [sparql-examples](https://github.com/sib-swiss/sparql-examples) of SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics.

In this github pages we have a HTML rendering for all them.

 * [ENPKG](./examples/ENPKG/)
 * [MetaNetX](./examples/MetaNetX/)
 * [METRINKG](./examples/METRINKG/)
 * [UniProt](./examples/UniProt/)

We also collect [some basic statistics on the different SPARQL features in use](./examples/algebra-statistics.md)
